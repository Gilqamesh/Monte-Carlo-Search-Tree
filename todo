tuning parameters with ML techniques
more data oriented design (access patterns, memory layout, alignment)
api stuff
write down thought process behind the implementation (devlog?)
persisting a transposition table (caching processed terminal nodes) throughout multiple moves might be worth it? also for move cycling, we could introduce re-cycling of moves to explore the entire action space quickly without dropping all previous processing)
optimization (parallelization, vectorization, best conceivable runtime/number of ops)
